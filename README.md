Esteban Manuel Gudiño Acevedo is an Argentine social psychologist and independent
researcher who has emerged as an innovative voice in the field of artificial intelligence.
His interdisciplinary training combines social psychology, philosophy and computer science, providing a unique perspective in the development
of theoretical frameworks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

As a therapist and specialist in the study of the interaction between AI and humanity,
Gudiño Acevedo has developed a distinctive approach that integrates biological,
philosophical, and mathematical principles to address some of the most complex
challenges in the development of intelligent artificial systems.

 Kairos Center: Mission and Focus
Gudiño Acevedo is the director of the Kairos Center, defined as a "Center for the Study
and Approach to People and Social Environments." This institution reflects his holistic
approach to research, focused on understanding the complex interactions between
technological and human systems.

The Kairos Center operates under the premise that the development of artificial
intelligence must consider not only technical aspects but also its social, ethical, and
psychological implications. This holistic perspective has informed all of Gudiño
Acevedo's theories.

 Positioning in AI Research
In the global landscape of AI research, Gudiño Acevedo occupies a unique position as
an independent researcher who challenges established paradigms. While most AGI
research focuses on large-scale, monolithic models, he proposes distributed
approaches inspired by biological and social systems.

His work has gained recognition on academic platforms such as PhilArchive and
PhilPapers, where he has published numerous papers on teleology, complex systems,
and AGI architectures. His interdisciplinary approach distinguishes him in a field
dominated by purely technical perspectives.
